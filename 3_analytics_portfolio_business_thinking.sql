Task 4: Churn Analysis (90-Day Definition)
Business Objective:
Identify customers who have gone silent for 90+ days after any purchase.
This uses event-based churn definition: a customer can enter churn multiple times

- This model captures both "final churn" and "temporary churn episodes".

more than 7 calendar days. For strict calendar-day windows,
a date spine (calendar table) would be required.
