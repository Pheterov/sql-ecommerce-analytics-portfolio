  to a CTE and then filtered by WHERE in final select.

Task 11: Growth Analysis - New vs Existing Customers
Business Objective:
Determine whether company growth is driven by acquiring new customers
or increasing revenue from existing customers.
Methodology:
1. Aggregates revenue to customer-month level.
2. Identifies each customer's first purchase month.
3. Classifies revenue as "new" (first month) or "returning" (subsequent months).
4. Tracks monthly trend of revenue share from both segments.

Analytical Insight:
Data shows 2018 was primarily an acquisition phase (new customer revenue dominant).
From 2019 onward, the company entered a retention phase where returning customers
generate the majority of revenue, indicating successful customer relationship building.
