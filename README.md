## 📝 Documented Assumptions

```sql
-- Revenue = calculated at order_date (regardless of shipping)
-- position_discount = multiplier 0–1 (0 = no discount)
-- NULL in discount/price → treated as 0
-- shipping_date < order_date → excluded from shipping metrics
-- "New customer" = first order in that calendar month
