# SQL Analytics Portfolio — Supersales modified by KajoData

**Business-focused SQL analysis project built on an e-commerce dataset.**  
This repository presents a collection of SQL solutions for real-world analytical problems related to sales performance, customer behavior, retention, promotions, and product analytics.

The goal of this project is not only to show SQL syntax proficiency, but also to demonstrate:
- structured analytical thinking,
- correct aggregation logic,
- business interpretation of results,
- clean and maintainable query design.

---

## Project Overview

This portfolio is based on the **Supersales modified by KajoData** dataset and simulates the type of work performed by a **Data Analyst / BI Analyst / E-commerce Analyst** in a real business environment.

The analyses focus on questions such as:
- How is revenue changing over time?
- Which products and categories generate the highest value?
- Are customers returning after their first purchase?
- Do discounts improve or dilute business performance?
- Is company growth driven by acquisition or retention?

All solutions were written in **MySQL 8+** and designed with readability, business usefulness, and production-style structure in mind.

- `JOIN`
- `GROUP BY`
- `COUNT(DISTINCT ...)`
- `CASE WHEN`
- date transformations and time granularity handling

### Analytical SQL
- Common Table Expressions (**CTE**)
- Window Functions:
  - `LAG()`
  - `LEAD()`
  - `ROW_NUMBER()`
  - `DENSE_RANK()`
  - `NTILE()`
  - `MIN() OVER()`
  - `FIRST_VALUE()`
  - `LAST_VALUE()`

### Business Analytics Concepts

## Database Structure

```bash

The project uses the **supersales - modified by KajoData** database, consisting of the following tables:

orders
├── order_id (INT)
├── customer_id (INT)
├── order_date (DATE)
├── shipping_date (DATE)
├── shipping_mode (VARCHAR)
├── delivery_country (VARCHAR)
├── delivery_city (VARCHAR)
├── delivery_state (VARCHAR)
└── order_return (INT)

order_positions
├── order_id (INT)
├── order_position_id (INT)
├── product_id (INT)
├── item_quantity (INT)
└── position_discount (FLOAT)

products
├── product_id (INT)
├── group_id (INT)
├── product_name (VARCHAR)
└── product_price (FLOAT)

product_groups
├── group_id (INT)
├── product_group (VARCHAR)
└── category (VARCHAR)

order_ratings
├── order_id (INT)
└── rating (INT)

order_returns
├── order_id (INT)
└── next_order_free (INT)

### Relationships
orders ──── order_positions ──── products ──── product_groups
│ │
│ └── (many positions per order)
│
├── order_ratings (1:1)
└── order_returns (1:1)
```

### Representative Business Problems Solved

### Monthly Revenue Performance
- total revenue by month
- number of orders
- number of unique customers
- average order value (AOV)

### Product & Category Analysis
- top-selling products by units sold
- top products by monthly revenue
- category contribution to total company revenue

### Customer Analytics
- new vs returning customers
- one-time customers and their share of total revenue
- customer revenue ranking
- average revenue per active month

### Retention & Growth
- month-over-month revenue growth
- M+1 retention rate
- growth source analysis: new customers vs returning customers

### Discount & Promotion Analysis
- discounted vs non-discounted orders
- impact of discounts on order value
- monthly percentage of discounted orders
- Example Analytical Approach
- The SQL in this repository follows a consistent analytical structure:

Choose the correct level of granularity
- Example: month, customer-month, or order-level.

Prepare the data with CTEs
- This improves readability and makes each step logically testable.

Use window functions only when they are the right tool
- Ranking, month-over-month comparisons,
  first purchase logic, and retention calculations.

Prioritize business meaning over unnecessary complexity
- Queries are designed to answer business questions clearly, not just to be syntactically clever.

---

### Why This Repository Exists
- This project was built as part of a structured preparation path
- for Junior / Junior+ Data Analyst roles and evolved into a portfolio.

### The key objective was to move beyond:

writing queries that “work”, and toward writing queries that are:
- correct,
- explainable,
- scalable,
- and business-relevant.

---

### Tools Used
- MySQL 8+
- DBeaver
- Git / GitHub

### How to Use
- Clone the repository
- Open the SQL file in your SQL editor
- Connect to a MySQL environment with the supersales dataset
- Run queries individually

---

### What Recruiters / Hiring Managers Can Expect Here
This repository is intended to showcase:

- practical SQL problem solving,
- understanding of analytical business questions,
- ability to translate requirements into clear query logic,
- portfolio-quality communication through code comments and structure.

---

### Planned extensions of this repository may include:

- cohort analysis,
- churn logic,
- RFM segmentation,
- rolling averages,
- anomaly detection,
- dashboard-ready SQL outputs.
